# EECS 281: Data Structures and Algorithms, 24 Fall

Welcome to my 281 archive!

If you want to read my lecture notes and found a lot of Chinese words that you could not read, sorry about that!

In [practice-code] I put some implementations of data structure and algorithms sketched in lecture that were not implemented.

In [project-starter] I put our project specs and some test files in case you have not taken the course and would like to try. I cannot put my answers because it violates the honor code, but I did put my ideas and process of debugging in [notes-project-optimization] (Again, sorry about that if you have trouble reading that.)
