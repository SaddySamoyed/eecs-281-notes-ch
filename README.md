# EECS 281: Data Structures and Algorithms, 24 Fall

Welcome to my 281 archive!

This notes include implementations of basic data structures: union-find sets, unordered_map by hash table, AVL tree, graph represented by adjacency matrix&list and a lot more with optimization. Also, basic algorithms like Dijkstra's, Prim's, Kruskal's and dp problems are included, both proof sketch and implementation.

If you want to read my lecture notes and found a lot of Chinese words that you could not read, sorry about that!

In [practice-code] I put some implementations of data structure and algorithms sketched in lecture that were not implemented.

In [project-starter] I put our project specs and some test files in case you have not taken the course and would like to try. I cannot put my answers because it violates the honor code, but I did put my ideas and process of debugging in [notes-project-optimization] (Again, sorry about that if you have trouble reading that.)
